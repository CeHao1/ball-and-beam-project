# how to use it
1. Install control system toolbox
2. test run_matlab_ball_and_beam 
3. test run_simulink_ball_and_beam 
4. In LQR_01, Q and R are weight matrix. We can tune the parameters.


The matlab result and Simulink result might be different.
Running the Simulink might take more than 1 minute, so please wait for a while.


# ball-and-beam-project
EE222/ME237 Nonlinear Systems, Spring 2022, Starter code for the course project.

## Code Instructions
- Install MATLAB and Simulink by using the Berkeley academic license.
- Run `setup.m` or add the repository and the subfolders to the matlab path.
- You only need to change one file for developing your controller: `studentControllerInterface.m`
- To test your controller, run either `run_matlab_ball_and_beam.m` or `run_simulink_ball_and_beam.m`.
- For more details, please read the attached [pdf](EE_222_Course_Project.pdf).
